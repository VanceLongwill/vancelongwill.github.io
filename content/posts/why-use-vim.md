In the era of modern text editors / IDEs like visual studio code, why should you learn an esoteric editor like vim?

As a front-end developer, I was the only one among my previous colleagues who used vim. Although it did slow me down at first,once I got the hang of it I began to appreciate the time I invested. Despite having spent a large portion of my free-time as a teenager toying around with various linux distros, I avoided vim as much as humanly possible. 

In my early days as a web dev, I used Atom and a myriad of plugins to write HTML/CSS/JavaScript. While this, like VS code, is a perfectly valid choice, I didn't (and still don't) have a very powerful laptop. Both of those editors, relying on Electron for their GUIs, were too bulky and slow for a low resource machine like mine. The newest macbook pro which I had the pleasure of using at work spoiled me, I wanted the snappy performance on my ageing personal laptop. All roads led to VIM. At first I aimed to replicate the setup I had in VS Code with neovim and a bunch of plugins. That was before I realised that I didn't need them at all. All those plugins were doing was adding more layers of abstraction to my workflow. Learning the tools underlying those plugins was much more useful. There was no real need for a GIT plugin, an emmet plugin, an eslint plugin, or a typescipt plugin when all those tasks could just as easily (IMO) be performed via the command line. Plugins break, lose support and have to be installed on every machine you use, which seemed to me like another headache. Really making an effort to learn GNU CLI tools made me a more efficient developer and added a bunch of portable utilities to my toolbox.

When I entered enterprise working environments, I noticed that most developers were using 2-3 screens, a mouse, an ergonomic keyboard and many other bells and whistles just to get their work done. Being a minimalist, I wanted to learn how to best utilise the tools infront of me.

Over the last 4 years, I've also travelled a lot, which means I've been constrained to a single screen, laptop keyboard and touchpad. Using the touchpad to select text and perform other common editing tasks was hugely cumbersome. A few months later I developed a minor case of RSI/CTS in my right hand. At that point I needed a more comfortable way to interact with my laptop so I learned many keyboard shortcuts. 

The elitist in me then started looking to VIM for a smarter editing experience. I wanted to become a member of the seemingly elite club who could actually use this editor. I was drawn in my the promised rewards of a lightning fast editing experience. Swapping button mashing, scrolling and clicking for the vim methodology was a catalyst for becoming a better coder. My hands were darting across the laptop keyboard like they did across the keys of a piano - without my knowledge or even full attention. Having committed my most common editing tasks to muscle memory, I had more headspace to focus on the programming task at hand. 

In spite of the initial frustration I experienced when learning VIM, its methodology made my editing a lot more calm and controlled. In turn, the logical nature of vim commands led me to write code with a think first do later approach. Now, rather than pressing the up arrow key 15 times, each stress-filled press driving me closer to meltdown, I have a muscle memory toolkit of useful shortcuts that will take me anywhere I want to go in a few fluid keystrokes. My concentration was also improved by vim's inherent lack of distractions. As I'm writing this article there is nothing on my screen but the text itself, a thin column of line numbers, and a small status bar at the bottom. No menus or other distractions, just one thing at a time.
